I knew some of the points but definitely didn't realize a woman always had a male guardian. I didn't realize if her husband died, her son could become her guardian. Where is the dignity in that? Can you imagine how bad it would feel to need permission to work, go to school, rent an apartment, do anything you want basically? And to need to get permission from your own child? Imagine rasing a child, feeding him, chaging his diapers, teaching him how to act... and then suddenly needing that child's permission to do anything or have to get his signature on anything. That's so demoralizing. Women really are treated like property there.

I don't have time to discuss all issues, obviously, but I'll just say this.  To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.
