This is a scary example of how close terrorism even years after September 11th is still so predominantly on our minds. I really enjoyed how this article went into depth with who this man is, how he is connected to bad people like Osama Bin Laden, and how they are working to prevent anything like this from happening again in the future. It is a little scary to read about things like this because unfortunately it is a reminder that these things can and do still happen today, but it also helps remind you to stay vigilant, be smart, and always know what is going on around you.

Sweden just put out a study that showed that air pollution might be impacting young children even more so than adults. Children are much less powerful to control this situation, but they are suffering the most. It seems like nitrogen dioxide might be playing a major part in making the environment's air pollution so that it impacts the development of young children, and the increased rates of psychological problems might be attributed to nitrogen dioxide. I hope that more research is done on this, and I hope that we can find some way to take environmental issues more seriously.	1.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	105000.0	[BOS] I know that I tend to get on my high-horse about political and world issues, but it's just a shame that we are not taking care of the climate globally.

R_3MGoZ0UN4oiUBww_2	R_3MGoZ0UN4oiUBww	95	Wow, I just read a VERY disturbing article on climate change and how it has been affecting forest fires in the United States. It appears that due to the increased temperatures and things drying out because of it, that the amount of forest fires has been steadily increasing. I must say that it sure seems that California in particular has been experiencing alot of fires over the last few years. Hopefully we start to get a better handle on climate change, as well as more effective ways of dealing with fires that do occur.	1.0	6.0	1.0	53.0	95000.0	[BOS] Wow, I just read a VERY disturbing article on climate change and how it has been affecting forest fires in the United States.
