He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work.

A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	[BOS] I just read an article about a very strong Category 5 typhoon, ‘Typhoon Meranti’, which grew stronger as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday.

R_1Iu8tApfebA0WZs_5	R_1Iu8tApfebA0WZs	338	2.833	5.375	0	1	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	[BOS] I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

It stated that boy was helping his dad harvest food when he fell in this well that was only 1 foot wide and that no adults could fit in it to go down and rescue him! Can you even imagine what that father must have been feeling knowing that his little boy fell in this well while helping him and he could not get down there to help him! I just imagine how heartbreaking this whole situation must have been for the family and for the rescuers who spent days trying everything they could to get to him and potentially help him. As a mom, it just makes me sick to think that I could be in a situation like that and do nothing to help one of my babies!	sadness	2	5	1	28	62000	7.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	4.0	2.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	[BOS] Wow!

However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do.

I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.	surprise	1	6	1	32	50000	5.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	6.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.429	[BOS] I think this article is really inspirational.
